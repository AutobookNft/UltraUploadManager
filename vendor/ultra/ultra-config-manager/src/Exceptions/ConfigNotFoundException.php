/**
 * üéØ Purpose: Signals that a specifically requested configuration entry
 *    (identified by key or ID) could not be located within the UCM persistence layer (database/cache).
 *    This provides a semantically distinct error compared to general database connection
 *    or query failures handled by `PersistenceException`.
 *
 * üß± Structure:
 *    - Extends `PersistenceException`, inheriting its base behavior for persistence-related errors.
 *    - Overrides the constructor to provide a default message specific to "not found" scenarios.
 *    - Does not add new properties or methods, focuses on semantic differentiation.
 *
 * üß© Context: Thrown primarily by `ConfigDaoInterface` implementations (like `EloquentConfigDao`)
 *    when methods like `getConfigById` or `getConfigByKey` fail to find a matching record.
 *    It is also thrown by `UltraConfigManager::getOrFail()` when a required key is missing.
 *    It is intended to be caught by higher-level services or controllers that need to
 *    distinguish between a non-existent configuration and other data access problems.
 *
 * üõ†Ô∏è Usage:
 *    ```php
 *    try {
 *        $value = $ucm->getOrFail('required.setting');
 *        // ... use value ...
 *    } catch (ConfigNotFoundException $e) {
 *        // Handle the specific "not found" case, e.g., use a default, log, or return error response.
 *        Log::warning("Required setting 'required.setting' not found, using fallback.");
 *        // ... fallback logic ...
 *    } catch (PersistenceException $e) {
 *        // Handle other database-related errors during config access.
 *        Log::error("Database error accessing configuration: " . $e->getMessage());
 *        // ... general error handling ...
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * üö¶ Signals:
 *    - Explicitly indicates that the requested configuration key/ID does **not exist** in the configured store.
 *    - Inherits the signal of a persistence-related issue from `PersistenceException`.
 *
 * ü§ù Dependencies:
 *    - PHP `Throwable` interface.
 *    - `Ultra\UltraConfigManager\Exceptions\PersistenceException` (Parent class).
 *
 * üõ°Ô∏è Privacy (GDPR): Generally low privacy impact itself, but the context in which it's thrown
 *    (e.g., trying to access a specific user's config) might have implications managed by the caller.
 *    The exception message should avoid exposing sensitive key names if possible, though the default is generic.
 *
 * üß™ Testing:
 *    - Verify that DAO methods throw this specific exception when a record is not found (e.g., using `findOrFail` and catching `ModelNotFoundException`).
 *    - Verify that `UltraConfigManager::getOrFail` throws this exception for missing keys.
 *    - Test `catch` blocks specifically designed for `ConfigNotFoundException`.
 *
 * üí° Logic: Simple extension of `PersistenceException` to provide a clear, specific meaning for "not found" errors within the UCM domain.
